# Design Principles for ProtoMap

The most important principle is using the latest technology as fundament. ProtoMap is freshly developed and starts of right as .NET 5 is about to release. So while the
core library (which exposes the *Modelling API*) should be built on top of **.Net Standard 2.1** the rest is done using **.NET 5** and WPF.

Thus the *language standard* will be **C#9**.
