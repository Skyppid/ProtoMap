# ProtoMap
A simple yet powerful tool for binary format and protocol design.

**NOTICE:** This is an early WIP project. Active development is done on the [develop](https://github.com/Skyppid/ProtoMap/tree/develop) branch. There you can also find design documents and other stuff. Results will be merged upon milestone completion (or as soon as there's a usable version ready).

The master branch will primarily act as "ready-to-use" state (be it Preview, RC or Release).

Participation is not expected as of now, but in case anyone wants to share ideas, feel free to add them as issues.
