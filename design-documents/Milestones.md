# Project Milestones

Milestones for ProtoMap are ordered by planets from sun *outwards*. The following three milestones are rolled out as of now:



**NOTICE:** Milestones will be explained in more detail once started - as future milestones can change drastically due to unpredicted development changes.

## Version 0.1 - SUN

The 'Sun' milestone basically is the source of the project. Core implementation with an **IOC**-backed foundation which exposes a basic project, plugin and logging system. With a solid (but not final) foundation the implementation for the first editor plugin should be started: a file format designer. At this stage the editor itself will be rudimentary with poor usability. It should expose the very least functionality for designing simple binary file formats.

## Version 0.2 - Mercury

'Mercury' aims for a more robust core system. The project and plugin system should be extended further.



## Version 0.3 - Venus

The 'Venus' milestone should bring feature completion to the *File Format Designer*.
