# Information about Design Documents

This folder covers documents about certain core elements of ProtoMap and how they **should** be implemented. This does *not* necessarily mean that it will be implemented that way, but simply acts as design guideline and as collection hotspot for ideas and possible implementations.



Once other contributors join the ProtoMap development, this can also act as center of discussions for implementation strategies.
