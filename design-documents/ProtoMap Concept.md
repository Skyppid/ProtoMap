# Concept

ProtoMap is intended to be a development and design utility for developers which should make it easier to design and document **Binary File Formats** and **(Network) Protocols**.





## Personal Interest

I have worked on many network protocols and file formats over my years. I never implemented anything particularily complex (like PDF, XLSX, etc.) but what's always been bothering me was the fact, that it is really annoying to design.

Iteration over iteration you have to change many things and often data is positioned relatively to each other via offsets and fixed-sized fields. I've done it in Excel and tried other things but it always ended in spending more time moving cells around than actually acomplishing anything.



Last but not least a protocol designed in Excel is rather confusing. Thus the idea for ProtoMap came up. A tool that should offer specific tools for making the design process easier and end up packing the whole format up into a readable document.
